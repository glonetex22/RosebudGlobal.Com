# Admin Routes

This directory contains admin API routes. Currently implemented:

- ✅ `auth.js` - Admin authentication (login, logout, password change, user creation)

## To be implemented:

- `dashboard.js` - Dashboard statistics
- `products.js` - Product management
- `categories.js` - Category management
- `orders.js` - Order management
- `inquiries.js` - Inquiry management
- `customers.js` - Customer management
- `settings.js` - Site settings
- `upload.js` - File upload handling

These routes are referenced in `server.js` but will need to be created as placeholder files or commented out until implemented.
